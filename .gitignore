# Delphi .gitignore (Curated)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT: This file must be renamed to ".gitignore" (without .txt extension)!
#
# This carefully curated .gitignore file is specifically optimized for
# Embarcadero Delphi development environments, supporting both legacy and
# modern versions.
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Copy this file to the root directory of your Git repository
# 2. Rename from "Delphi GitIgnore.txt" to ".gitignore"
# 3. Make project-specific adjustments if needed
#
# This file ignores:
# - Compiler and build output (e.g., .dcu, .exe, .dll)
# - IDE-generated metadata and user-specific files (.dsk, .local)
# - Backup and recovery files
# - Platform-specific output directories
# - Known version control systems and Delphi-specific tools
